# ðŸš— New Wheels - SQL Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
**New Wheels** is a vehicle resale company that connects buyers with pre-owned vehicles through its app.  
The app handles the entire process â€” from listing the vehicle to shipping it to the customer â€” and also collects after-sales feedback.  

Recently, New Wheels has experienced:
- Declining sales over the past year ðŸ“‰
- Lower customer ratings and feedback
- Reduced customer acquisition each quarter

This project uses SQL to analyze **sales trends, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and discounts** to generate a **quarterly business report** for the CEO.
